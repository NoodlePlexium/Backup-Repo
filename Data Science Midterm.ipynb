    "### 1. Domain and Objectives\n",
    "*The first step of the coursework is to identify and describe the domain-specific area.\n",
    "This is an area of industry or science where a linear regression model will contribute.\n",
    "It can be any field which can benefit from machine learning. Then state and justify\n",
    "the objectives of the project. Discuss its impact and contribution to the domain-\n",
    "specific area. State any contribution which the results may make to the challenge\n",
    "addressed.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Domain** <br>\n",
    "The resale industry revolves around buying products at low prices then repackaging and reselling these producs at market prices to generate a profit. This business strategy works as domain experts usually have a better idea of how things are priced thatn the general public. These experts can leverage their knowlege to find products that are undervalued. Resale exists in many industries, from selling bicycles on Facebook Marketplace to hunting down decrepid properties, refurbishing and flipping them. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Objectives and Justification** <br>\n",
    "In this project I am going to create a machine learning regression model that can predict the price of laptops given a list of specs. The market price of a laptop might not be derived from the sum total value of its components. Instead, a laptop's price depends on a combination of different elements, such as build quality, brand, consumer demand as well as technical specifications. A machine learning model is likely able to find relationships between dependencies and generate an accurate prediction, given enough training examples.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact and Contribution** <br>\n",
    "If the model can provide accurate enough predictions, it can be used in combination with a webscraper to look at hundreds of laptops on the internet and flag ones that may be considered \"undervalued\". By automating this process, an individual might gain a competitive edge in the resale business as they will have the ability to screen far more products than competitors."

The \"screen resolution\" value will need to be extracted and encoded as a numerical value in the range (0-1). Similarly, the \"storage\" attribute is not an scalar value, so it will have to be split into two separate attributes: \"ssd storage\" and \"hdd storage\"."
